# profit-and-loss
->This project is to calculate the break-even quantity for a given product to be manufactured. The break-even quantity is the point at which the total cost is equal to the total revenue.

->Thus, the break-even point identifies the minimum quantity of a product that must be sold to make the firmâ€™s revenue equal to the total cost of producing the product. 

->The break-even point is found when total revenue equals or exceeds the total cost.

->We need to create a table indicating the total cost, revenue, profit or loss, and profit or loss per unit for the range indicated.

->Divide the range into 25 equal steps for this analysis. If N is not divided by 25, use steps that are the integers closest to (k*N)/25 for k = 1 to 25. 
 
->Print a star next to the row that is closest to the break-even point. Print a star next to both if two rows are equidistant from the break-even point.
